### 2. Brieﬂy describe ASP.NET Web Forms.
ASP.NET web forms are pages that users request using a browser. They are compiled and executed on a server, then the framework generates the HTML that browsers can render

### 3. Brieﬂy describe ASP.NET.

### 4. Brieﬂy describe .NET.
.NET framework consists of the common language runtime and .NET framework class library. The runtime manages code at runtime

### 5. What is Representational State Transfer (REST)? This will take some independent research.
Servers don't store any "state" of the client. The state is determined client side and sent to the server. REST also allows for clients to request data without knowing the inner workings of the server (for example, file structure) of what it is requesting.

### 6. What is Agile Development? This will take some independent research.
Agile development emphasized smaller requirements, and developing code in smaller chunks. Continuous contact with the customer means adapting on the fly. Agile development anticipates and is responsive to change.

### 7. What is unit testing?
Unit testing is where small components or modules of code are tested for proper functionality

### 8. What year was ASP.NET MVC introduced?
2007

### 9. Describe URL routing. As part of your answer, discuss the concept of “clean URLs.”
URL routing refers to being able to control the URL schema and its relationship to your application

### 10. What is the relationship between Microsoft’s .NET platform and ASP.NET MVC?
ASPs.NET MVC is built on the .NET framework, which means it has access to all the features of the .NET framework.

### 11. Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern speciﬁcally, and in a sense this entire course is an extended examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) brieﬂy state the responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
The model is the guts of the system. Its where computation/processing takes place. Its workings are usually hidden from/independent of the view of the interface.

The View is an output of information

The controller accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view
