### ASP.NET MVC Ch 03

### 1. The book states, “Interactions with an MVC application follow a natural cycle of user actions and view updates, where the view is assumed to be stateless.” What does it mean for the view to be stateless?


### 2. The book identifies two kinds of models. Briefly describe each of them.


### 3. Give an example of separation of concerns from your own life experience. This should be a simple, everyday example.


### 4. What is a view engine?


### 5. The book notes that the three-tier structure, or n-tier model, is “the most widely used pattern for business applications.” Why do you think that this is true? An answer like, “Because it works well,” is not a sufficient answer to this question.


### 6. This question requires some outside research. When we study UWP, you will see that the UWP design pattern is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). What is the difference between MVC and MVVM that makes the first good for ASP.NET MVC and the second good for UWP?


### 7. Describe the two parts of the dependency injection (DI) design pattern.



### 8. Give an example of loose coupling from your own life experience. This should be a simple, everyday example.


###9. What are the two types of testing discussed in the book?


### 10. What are the seven steps of the test driven development (TDD) workflow, as stated in the book?
